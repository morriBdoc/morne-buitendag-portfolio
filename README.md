## 📌 Project Overview
This is my personal portfolio, built intentionally from the ground up. Following the [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) guide, I am building this site in stages to ensure a deep understanding of the core technologies before adopting high-level frameworks.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights (Phase 1 & 2)
In the current version of this portfolio, I focused on writing clean, maintainable, and modern code:

* **Modern CSS Techniques:** Used **CSS Nesting**, **Custom Properties (Variables)**, and the **Clamp** function for fluid typography.
* **Grid & Flexbox:** Implemented a complex grid layout on the home page and a self-adjusting `auto-fill` grid for projects.
* **Semantic Structure:** Used descriptive tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`) to ensure SEO and accessibility.
* **Mobile-First Design:** Fully responsive layout that adapts seamlessly from desktop to mobile screens.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `index.html`: Main landing page featuring an overview of my experience and education.
* `projects.html`: A categorized showcase of my coding and video editing work.
* `contact.html`: A clean contact form interface.
* `style.css`: Global styles and variables for site-wide consistency.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
During the CSS phase, I learned how to use `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr))`. This allowed me to create a responsive project gallery without writing multiple media queries for every screen size, making the code much more concise.
